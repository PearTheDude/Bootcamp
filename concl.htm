            <p>When I first heard about the bootcamp I thought it was going to be a sort of a week-long nightmare. The first announcement in the weeks leading up to it didn’t do much good either- we need to create portfolio, website, promise it is going to be a hard week. I really didn’t know what to expect, and I was a bit worried how I could possibly handle it. But come the first day I realized it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it was. During the week I managed to learn not only a considerable amount of a programming language but also some basics of programming in general. I covered such topics as functions, arrays, variables, shapes, conditions, types of input, conventions- concepts that different programming languages share. When I first came in only thing I knew about programming was a bit of HTML, but now I actually can confidently say that I that I do in fact understand how the code and the processing language – an actual programming language- works, and how to apply the different concepts I learned to create a well-functioning program. Now I find the idea of learning a new coding language less disturbing as now I understand one and I believe that that will help me to understand others.</p>
