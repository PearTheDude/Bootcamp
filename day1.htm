            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            
            <p>On day one I was introduced to a programming language called “processing”, and I began learning this language. We also were told about the structure and contents of said bootcamp, including the principle of peer-to-peer assistance, which was made obligatory for us to obey. Also tips on structuring our files and folders were given, and we were introduced to such programming conventions as camelCasing. During first part of the day concepts of basic drawing was explained, like, for instance lines, triangles, rectangles, ellipses etc. We were given training exercises, from which I covered every topic. After that we had our introduction to variables and shown the basic principles, on how to code these functions and where they could be used.</p>
            <p>After a break we returned to preview a video about processing, its inception and the possibilities the code can offer. In the video they interviewed the authors of processing, and they explained why they made it and for what purposes.  After that and further guidance in language covering the “random” function we were given an assignment, that was in a way challenge, to make a program that every time when restarted would be the same but in a way different. For my assignment I created a pear made out of triangles (view image below). Its form was the same every time but the color tone of each triangle varied every time. The code elements used in my program where “triangle”, “fill”, “random”. Because I finished early I decided to implement a feature in my program, to refresh it with a mouse click. With some help from the teaching staff, I learned the “void draw” and “void mouseClicked”, functions that enabled me to implement this feature in my program successfully.
