            <h2>Day 2</h2>
            
            <p>On day two I received full training on the “void” feature. We also were introduced to the “float” variable, which allows using numbers after decimal point.  That allowed me to implement basic movement into my future programs. After short period of training, and a small break, the next topic was presented to us- the “if” function, or the logical operators. It allows me to use logic, in a true or false sense in my programs. There can also be multiple operators stacked, to execute multiple rules simultaneously. To further expand our knowledge of logical operators, an exercise was carried out in class having the class to sit, stand or raise our hands, regarding the function presented to us on the screen. </p>
                
            <p>After the lunch break we were presented with two videos, both containing programs made in processing. One was used to make graphics for a music video, other to create an interactive exhibit. These were used as a type of prologue to topic on interactivity.  During this topic we were taught how to use mouse and keyboard to allow user to interact with our program. During the lecture I started to work on a small program that allows user to type in letters or words, to start writing in next line or to reset the page. I wanted to implement a possibility to change the font color using arrow keys, but I didn’t manage to figure out the bugs, as we were given a task to create a simple game.

            <p>I wanted to create a game where player needs to cut one of three wires of an explosive. The catch was that no matter which wire was cut, player would lose the game, referencing another game, which can only be lost. I wanted make the program to draw a “bomb” with three wires that player could cut using a button on keyboard view image below). I thought I could do that by making the games code similar to the one I made on day one by using “void keyPressed” to interact with “void draw”.  Although I thought I had great success in the beginning, I encountered bugs that I couldn’t figure out how to fix in the given time so I didn’t manage to finish my program. Later after the course had finished and I reviewed the code I realized that my code wouldn’t have worked, and I had written the code badly. For example I should have used “void” functions to create multiple screens and “if” functions to trigger them, but on day two I didn’t know how to do it properly.
