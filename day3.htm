            <h2>Day 3</h2>
            
            <p>On day 3, after being reminded about the programming conventions such as “camelCasing” and proper indentation we were presented with the days topics- repeat, loops and functions. These functions allow us to shorten our codes substantially, by using some basic math and logic. We were presented with a graph displaying how loops in programming work: initialize – test –action – update – (repeat from test). We also were introduced to “while” and “for” loops, and the difference were explained- “while” uses data defined outside of it, but “for” defines its own data. </p>
                
            <p>On second part of the day we were introduced to functions- ones that can be created by processing users themselves. That can be achieved with “void” functions. I had been introduced to these on day one, as I wanted implement a reset function for my application, but the I had no idea how it worked, or what “void” was supposed to be.  After this lecture I understood it, and saw what potential in my future programs it had and what I could do with it. I also realized it could have been used in my day 2 game to fix bugs if I had known how to use it properly back then.
            </p>
                
            <p>For create part we were given a task to create applications using loops and functions. That day the trend was making epilepsy triggers, with memes inside them. As I actually have epilepsy I decided not to do that, but instead use void to learn how to structure my programs and add multiple layers to them. I ended up having a small program, which had 12 buttons (generated using loops), and by clicking on them, user is directed to a different screen- either interactive or just a picture (view image below). The screens were created each in different “void” function and executed via “void draw”. In it were “if” functions, that compered integrals. If they were the same, it returned which “void” function to execute.
