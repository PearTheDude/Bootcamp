            <h2>Day 4</h2>
            
            <p>Day four was the last day that had listen part in it. The main talking point was arrays. They are data values that serve the same function, so they are stored under the same variable type for convenience. As loops yesterday arrays are also used to make the code shorter and more understandable, and also they are often used in combination with one another.

            <p>Later the group was given a decision between partitioning in a recap session or a masterclass for those who wanted to learn a bit more advanced programming, between which I chose the recap one as I didn’t feel that I could grasp what was defined as very advanced concepts. During the recap session we talked about how to create a simple drawing of a Christmas tree with some flickering lights(view image below). A similar task was given to us after the first days listen part, where we only had a little knowledge of how to program in processing, but now we were shown how to do the same thing with application of our advanced knowledge in processing language. After this lecture I thought maybe I should have gone to the advanced processing  talk as I found that the recap was actually too basic for me and that I might have been better off trying to understand a bit more complex concepts even if I would not be too successful, rather than again learning things I already understand.

            <p>For the create part we were tasked to create a new game this time compiling all of our knowledge. The game had to be original, but we could have taken inspiration from preexisting games. The rules of the assignment were to have a scoring system, an enemy and a main character. After brief brainstorm I decided to make a game in the theme of recent US presidential election, which turned out to be a kind of an election simulator. Before end of the day I managed to decide on the gameplay type (questions and answers format) , how the scoring system is going to work (explained in day 5, but it can be compared to the us presidential elections) and the overall look on the game. After that was done I laid down a few sketches  in my notebook on how the menu and game screen might look, in illustrator created title screen and buttons for menu,  and wrote some essential code(void setup and voids for title screens), to continue on main gameplay next day.
