            <h2>Day 5</h2>
            
            <p>There were no listen parts on day 5, but only one big assignment- to finish the game we started to create on day 4(view image below). Previous evening I was working on my game for a bit until I realized that the code structure I was using until then, where “if” functions inside of “void draw” triggered different screens. I showed my code to Peter and he suggested I use “switch” function to fix my problem. He also helped me by suggesting to me to use arrays for levels as they were basically the same and also use “switch” function for the buttons in the levels, to make the code more logical, shorter and easier to oversee. In the game there are also two scoring systems- one keeps score for each level separately, and other gives the end score. The level score is influenced by the answers player gives in each level- each answer gives some points to player and some points to AI. If players level points after completing a level is greater than that of the AI player wins that level.  Score for the end toll adds up from the points that victory in each level gives. If all points gained from each level won is greater than those that AI collected, player wins the game, otherwise loses it. After I finished the code I ended up with nearly 1000 lines of code, but that can be attributed to having 7 levels and around 30 different game screens. After finishing the code and reviewing it I realized I could have used arrays in some more cases, but I figured that it actually would not make the code much shorter, and I might break it in the process, so as the application was working, I decided to leave it how it is.</p>
